liri-node-app
This is an application that allows the user to search for one of four commands:

Search Spotify for information on a song
Search OMDB for information on a movie
Search Bands In Town for a band;s upcoming concerts
Run one of these commands from a separate file called 'do-what-it-says'
To use this CLI program, you will have to create your own '.env' file. In this file you will need to specify your own spotify API credentials. It should look something like this:

SPOTIFY_ID= your ID given by the spotify API

SPOTIFY_SECRET=your secret from the spotify API
Run NPM install, and the following dependencies will be installed: axios, dotenv, inquirer, moment, node-spotify-api
